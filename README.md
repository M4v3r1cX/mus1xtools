# Mus1xTools
Mus1xTools is my own little tool for managing my music library to how I use it. It barely works.

# Available Functions
> takeNumbersOut: Renames all files in folder to take out the first numbers from the track listing.
> For example, 01 - Intro.mp3 would be renamed to Intro.mp3

# Usage
java -jar musixtools.jar [function] [path]

# Why?
There's a crapload of better id3 tag editors out there but I just wanted a short program to rename my music files indistinctively from how the numeration started. 01 - , or 1-, or 01. They all should work.
I'm kind of a mad scientist here so I just think of something and make it happen. Mad engineer. Whatever.
